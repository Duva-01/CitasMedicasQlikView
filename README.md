# QlikView Project: Medical Appointments Analysis

This QlikView project analyzes and generates reports based on a medical appointment management system. It provides a comprehensive view of data related to doctors, patients, appointments, and diagnoses, with interactive visualizations and reports that support effective decision-making in healthcare management.

## Overview

The project leverages data stored in **SQL Server Express** to display key insights and trends within a healthcare setting. By importing and processing data in QlikView, the project provides an efficient way to navigate, visualize, and analyze data related to medical appointments, patient information, and diagnostic records.

### Key Features

- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards and charts to track information on medical appointments, diagnoses, doctors, and patients.
- **Automated Reports**: Scheduled reports can be set up in QlikView, allowing for regular analysis of healthcare metrics.
- **Data Relationships**: Relational analysis between doctors, patients, appointments, and diagnoses, offering a clear view of the connections within the medical data.

### Technologies Used

- **QlikView Personal Edition**: For interactive data analysis and report generation.
- **SQL Server Express**: Serves as the data source, providing a relational database to store and manage healthcare-related information.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- **QlikView Personal Edition** installed.
- **SQL Server Express** configured with a database containing tables for medical appointments, doctors, patients, and diagnoses.

### Setup Steps

1. **Connect to SQL Server Express**: Ensure that the database connection in QlikView points to your SQL Server Express instance.
2. **Load Data into QlikView**: Use QlikView’s script editor to load relevant tables from SQL Server Express (e.g., `Appointments`, `Doctors`, `Patients`, and `Diagnoses`).
3. **Set Up Data Relationships**: Define key relationships between tables (e.g., linking patients to their appointments and doctors) to ensure coherent data analysis and reporting.
4. **Design Reports**: Use QlikView’s reporting tools to create custom charts and dashboards based on the imported medical data.

## Example Reports and Analysis

After loading and configuring the data in QlikView, you can create and view various types of reports, such as:

- **Appointment Metrics**: Track the number of appointments over time, grouped by doctor or patient.
- **Diagnostic Trends**: Visualize the most common diagnoses and their distribution among patients.
- **Doctor Activity**: Monitor each doctor's appointment frequency, offering insights into their workload and patient engagement.

This QlikView project is a powerful tool for healthcare data analysis, providing clear, accessible reports and visualizations that support efficient decision-making in medical appointment management.
